Challenge given by Dbserver

Classe DriverManager is responsible for starting the browser and assigning the WebDriver object.
It uses Bonigarcia repo to select and download the appropriate webdriver from Google or Firefox, for instance. However, should problems arise from this, kindly et it up manually by:
- downloding the webdriver
- setting System.Property to the path to the chromedriver executable.
